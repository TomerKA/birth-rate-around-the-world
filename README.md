Hello and welcome!

This repository contains the code and data for our statistical theory project.

The code is written in python in a jupyter notebook file.

The data is contained in the two excel files.

After installing jupyter notebook environment, just put the two excel files in the same folder with the ipynb file and run the notebook.
